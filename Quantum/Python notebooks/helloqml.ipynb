       "'Final Report: A Practical Benchmark of a Quantum-Enhanced RAG System vs. a Classical Counterpart\\nDate: Saturday, August 16, 2025\\nLocation: Bengaluru, Karnataka, India\\nLead Investigator: Anirudh R\\nProject Status: Complete\\n\\nExecutive Summary\\nThis project sought to develop and evaluate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline enhanced\\nwith a quantum re-ranking component. A complete, end-to-end system was successfully built, connecting\\nto a MongoDB Atlas vector database, performing on-demand training of a quantum model on the 127-qubit\\nibm_brisbane processor, and generating answers with a Large Language Model. For a rigorous comparison,\\nan identical \"digital twin\" system was constructed using a classical machine learning model.\\n\\nThe final head-to-head benchmark on a sample query revealed that while both systems were functional,\\nthe classical system produced a slightly more accurate and logical ranking. Crucially, it did so in\\nseconds, whereas the quantum system required several hours. The key finding is that for practical NLP\\ntasks with current (c. 2025) technology, a well-engineered classical system is superior across all key\\nmetrics: performance, speed, and resource efficiency. The project succeeded as a benchmark, realistically\\nassessing the current state-of-the-art and highlighting the critical role of feature engineering and the\\nchallenges of hardware noise in the NISQ era.\\n\\n1. Project Objective\\nThe primary goal was to move beyond theoretical concepts and build a functional, real-world application\\nthat integrates a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) into a RAG pipeline. The objective was twofold:\\n\\nTo successfully navigate the complex Qiskit Runtime API and hardware requirements to build a robust\\nquantum application.\\n\\nTo perform a fair, \"apples-to-apples\" comparison against an equivalent classical system to assess any\\npotential \"quantum advantage\" on a practical task.\\n\\n2. Final System Architecture\\nThe final architecture evolved into a sophisticated, on-demand training RAG pipeline:\\n\\nUser Query\\n     |\\n     V\\n[ 1. Classical Retrieval ]\\n   - Connects to MongoDB Atlas.\\n   - Embeds query with SentenceTransformer.\\n   - Retrieves Top 1000 document candidates via Atlas Vector Search.\\n     |\\n     V\\n[ 2. Dynamic Training Set Creation ]\\n   - Selects Top 5 (Pseudo-Label: Relevant) and Bottom 5 (Pseudo-Label: Irrelevant).\\n   - Creates a 10-element, high-contrast, query-specific training set.\\n     |\\n     V\\n[ 3. On-Demand Re-Ranker Training ]\\n   - The Re-Ranker Engine (either Quantum or Classical) is trained from scratch on this new dataset.\\n     |\\n     V\\n[ 4. Fine-Grained Re-Ranking ]\\n   - The newly trained model scores the initial Top 20 candidates.\\n   - The list is sorted based on these new, learned relevance scores.\\n     |\\n     V\\n[ 5. Augment & Generate ]\\n   - The Top 2 re-ranked documents are formatted into a context.\\n   - The context and original query are sent to a Llama LLM for final answer generation.\\n3. The Contenders: Model Implementation\\n3.1 The Quantum Re-Ranker (The \"F1 Car\")\\n\\nModel: A Variational Quantum Classifier.\\n\\nCircuit: A ZZFeatureMap for data encoding and a RealAmplitudes ansatz for the trainable component.\\n\\nHardware: The 127-qubit ibm_brisbane superconducting processor, accessed via IBM Quantum Platform.\\n\\nWorkflow: The parameterized circuit was transpiled to be ISA-compliant with the hardware. The model\\nwas trained iteratively using the COBYLA optimizer, with each iteration submitting a new job to the\\nquantum backend.\\n\\n3.2 The Classical Re-Ranker (The \"City Car\")\\n\\nModel: A SGDClassifier from Scikit-learn, configured for logistic regression.\\n\\nFeatures: The model was trained on two \"intelligent features\":\\n\\nA normalized semantic similarity score derived from the MongoDB vectorSearchScore.\\n\\nA keyword overlap score between the query and the document.\\n\\nHardware: A standard CPU.\\n\\n4. Experimental Results: Head-to-Head Comparison\\nThe systems were tasked with answering the query: \"Is Tesla a good company?\"\\n\\n4.1.

The quantum model learned a broader concept of\\n\"tech company\" or \"autonomous technology,\" ranking Dell highest, and placing the explicit Tesla\\narticles slightly lower.\\n\\n4.2. Quantitative Metrics\\n\\nMetric\\tClassical System\\tQuantum System\\nFinal Accuracy\\tPerfect context provided to LLM.\\tGood, but slightly less precise context.\\nEnd-to-End Time\\t~ 2 minutes (dominated by DB retrieval)\\t~ 3-4 Hours (dominated by QPU queue times)\\nCompute Resources\\tLocal CPU, Python environment\\tCloud access to IBM Quantum hardware\\n\\nExport to Sheets\\n5. Discussion\\nThe key takeaway is not that one technology is \"smarter,\" but that each operates under different\\nprinciples and constraints.\\n\\nFeature Engineering is Paramount: Our initial classical models failed catastrophically due to flawed,\\nhardcoded features. Only after engineering robust features (using the database\\'s semantic score) did\\nthe classical model perform well. This highlights that data quality and feature design are often\\nmore critical than the choice of a novel algorithm.\\n\\nHardware Noise Impacts Performance: The quantum model\\'s slightly \"fuzzier\" and less precise ranking\\nis a classic signature of a NISQ-era computation.
